  NOTES
  -----



  To do
  -----
    -VMS VERSION:
        -based on vms 1.05, but the 'fix slow text' option has been added.
            that includes m_lpDDSText, CTextManager (m_text), changes to
            DrawDarkTranslucentBox, the replacement of all DrawText calls
            (now routed through m_text), and adding the 'fix slow text' cb
            to the config panel.

    -KILLED FEATURES:
        -vj mode

    -NEW FEATURES FOR 1.04:
            -added the following variables for per-frame scripting: (all booleans, except 'gamma')
              wave_usedots, wave_thick, wave_additive, wave_brighten
                gamma, darken_center, wrap, invert, brighten, darken, solarize
                (also, note that echo_zoom, echo_alpha, and echo_orient were already in there,
                 but weren't covered in the documentation!)
        d   -fixed: spectrum w/512 samples + 256 separation -> infinite spike
        d   -reverted dumb changes to aspect ratio stuff
        d   -reverted wave_y fix; now it's backwards, just like it's always been
                (i.e. for wave's y position, 0=bottom and 1=top, which is opposite
                to the convention in the rest of milkdrop.  decided to keep the
                'bug' so presets don't need modified.)
        d   -fixed: Krash: Inconsistency bug - pressing Escape while in the code windows
                for custom waves completely takes you out of the editing menus,
                rather than back to the custom wave menu
        d   -when editing code: fix display of '&' character
        d   -internal texture size now has a little more bias toward a finer texture,
                based on the window size, when set to 'Auto'.  (Before, for example,
                to reach 1024x1024, the window had to be 768x768 or greater; now, it
                only has to be 640x640 (25% of the way there).  I adjusted it because
                before, at in-between resolutions like 767x767, it looked very grainy;
                now it will always look nice and crisp, at any window size, but still
                won't cause too much aliasing (due to downsampling for display).
        d   -fixed: rova:
                When creating presets have commented code // in the per_pixel section when cause error in preset.
                Example nothing in per_frame and just comments in the per_pixel. EXamples on repuest I have a few.
        d   -added kill keys:
                -CTRL+K kills all running sprites
                -CTRL+T kills current song title anim
                -CTRL+Y kills current custom message
        d   -notice to sprite users:
                -in milk_img.ini, color key can't be a range anymore; it's
                    now limited to just a single color.  'colorkey_lo' and
                    'colorkey_hi' have been replaced with just one setting,
                    'colorkey'.
        d   -song titles + custom messages are working again
        ?   -fixed?: crashes on window resize [out of mem]
                -Rova: BTW the same bug as krash with the window resizing.
                -NOT due to the 'integrate w/winamp' option.
                -> might be fixed now (had forgotten to release m_lpDDSText)
        <AFTER BETA 3..>
        d   -added checkbox to config screen to automatically turn SCROLL LOCK on @ startup
        d   -added alphanumeric seeking to the playlist; while playlist is up,
                you can now press A-Z and 0-9 to seek to the next song in the playlist
                that starts with that character.
        d   -<fixed major bug w/illegal mem access on song title launches;
                could have been causing crashing madness @ startup on many systems>
        d   -<fixed bug w/saving 64x48 mesh size>
        d   -<fixed squashed shapes>
        d   -<fixed 'invert' variable>
        d   -<fixed squashed song titles + custom msgs>
        ?   -<might have fixed scroll lock stuff>
        ?   -<might have fixed crashing; could have been due to null ptr for failed creation of song title texture.>
        ?   -<also might have solved any remaining resize or exit bugs by callign SetTexture(NULL)
                in DX8 cleanup.>
        d   -<fixed sizing issues with songtitle font.>
        d   -<fixed a potentially bogus call to deallocate memory on exit, when it was cleaning up the menus.>
        d   -<fixed more scroll lock issues>
        d   -<fixed broken Noughts & Crosses presets; max # of per-frame vars was one too few, after the additions of the new built-in variables.>
        d   -<hopefully fixed waveforms>
        <AFTER BETA 4>
            -now when playlist is up, SHIFT+A-Z seeks upward (while lowercase/regular a-z seeks downward).
            -custom shapes:
                -OH MY GOD
                -increased max. # of custom shapes (and waves) from 3 to 4
                -added 'texture' option, which allows you to use the last frame as a texture on the shape
                    -added "tex_ang" and "tex_zoom" params to control the texture coords
                -each frame, custom shapes now draw BEFORE regular waveform + custom waves
                -added init + per-frame vars: "texture", "additive", "thick", "tex_ang", "tex_zoom"
            -fixed valid characters for filenames when importing/exporting custom shapes/waves;
                also, it now gives error messages on error in import/export.
            -cranked max. meshsize up to 96x72
            -Krash, Rova: now the 'q' variables, as modified by the preset per-frame equations, are again
                readable by the custom waves + custom shapes.  Sorry about that.  Should be the end of the
                'q' confusion.
            -added 'meshx' and 'meshy' [read-only] variables to the preset init, per-frame, and per-pixel
                equations (...and inc'd the size of the global variable pool by 2).
            -removed t1-t8 vars for Custom Shapes; they were unnecessary (since there's no per-point code there).
            -protected custom waves from trying to draw when # of sample minus the separation is < 2
                (or 1 if drawing with dots)
            -fixed some [minor] preset-blending bugs in the custom wave code
            -created a visual map for the flow of values for the q1-q8 and t1-t8 variables:
                q_and_t_vars.gif (or something).
            -fixed clipping of onscreen text in low-video-memory situations.  Now, if there isn't enough
                video memory to create an offscreen texture that is at least 75% of the size of the
                screen (or to create at least a 256x256 one), it won't bother using one, and will instead draw text directly to the screen.
                Otherwise, if the texture is from 75%-99% of the screen size, text will now at least
                appear in the correct position on the screen so that it will be visible; this will mean
                that the right- and bottom-aligned text will no longer be fully right/bottom-aligned
                to the edge of the screen.
            -fixed blurry text
            -VJ mode is partially restored; the rest will come with beta 7 or the final release.  At the time of beta 6, VJ mode still has some glitches in it, but I'm working on them.  Most notably, it doesn't resize the text image when you resize the window; that's next on my list.
        <AFTER BETA 6:>
            -now sprites can burn-in on any frame, not just on the last frame.
                set 'burn' to one (in the sprite code) on any frame to make it burn in.
                this will break some older sprites, but it's super easy to fix, and
                I think it's worth it. =)  thanks to papaw00dy for the suggestion!
            -fixed the asymptotic-value bug with custom waves using spectral data & having < 512 samples (thanks to telek's example!)
            -fixed motion vectors' reversed Y positioning.
            -fixed truncation ("...") of long custom messages
            -fixed that pesky bug w/the last line of code on a page
            -fixed the x-positioning of custom waves & shapes.  Before, if you were
                saving some coordinates from the preset's per-frame equations (say in q1 and q2)
                and then you set "x = q1; y = q2;" in a custom shape's per-frame code
                (or in a custom wave's per-point code), the x position wouldn't really be
                in the right place, because of aspect ratio multiplications.  Before, you had
                to actually write "x = (q1-0.5)*0.75 + 0.5; y = q2;" to get it to line up;
                now it's fixed, though, and you can just write "x = q1; y = q2;".
            -fixed some bugs where the plugin start up, in windowed mode, on the wrong window
                (and hence run super slow).
            -fixed some bugs w/a munged window frame when the "integrate with winamp" option
                was checked.
        <AFTER BETA 7:>
            -preset ratings are no longer read in all at once; instead, they are scanned in
                1 per frame until they're all in.  This fixes the long pauses when you switch
                to a directory that has many hundreds of presets.  If you want to switch
                back to the old way (read them all in at once), there is an option for it
                in the config panel.
            -cranked max. mesh size up to 128x96
            -fixed bug in custom shape per-frame code, where t1-t8 vars were not
                resetting, at the beginning of each frame, to the values that they had
                @ the end of the custom shape init code's execution.

            -random sprites (...they can just write a prog for this, tho)
            -Text-entry mode.
                -Like your favorite online game, hit T or something to enter 'text entry' mode. Type a message, then either hit ESC to clear and cancel text-entry mode, or ENTER to display the text on top of the vis. Easier for custom messages than editing the INI file (and probably stopping or minimizing milkdrop to do it) and reloading.

                -preset authoring:
                    -there are 11 variable pools:
                        preset:
                            a) preset init & per-frame code
                            b) preset per-pixel code
                        custom wave 1:
                            c) init & per-frame code
                            d) per-point code
                        custom wave 2:
                            e) init & per-frame code
                            f) per-point code
                        custom wave 3:
                            g) init & per-frame code
                            h) per-point code
                        i) custom shape 1: init & per-frame code
                        j) custom shape 2: init & per-frame code
                        k) custom shape 3: init & per-frame code

                    -all of these have predefined variables, the values of many of which
                        trickle down from init code, to per-frame code, to per-pixel code,
                        when the same variable is defined for each of these.
                    -however, variables that you define ("my_var = 5;") do NOT trickle down.
                        To allow you to pass custom values from, say, your per-frame code
                        to your per-pixel code, the variables q1 through q8 were created.
                        For custom waves and custom shapes, t1 through t8 work similarly.
                    -q1-q8:
                        -purpose: to allow [custom] values to carry from {the preset init
                            and/or per-frame equations}, TO: {the per-pixel equations},
                            {custom waves}, and {custom shapes}.
                        -are first set in preset init code.

                            they had at the end of the preset init code.
                        -can be modified in per-frame code...
                            -changes WILL be passed on to the per-pixel code
                            -changes WILL pass on to the q1-q8 vars in the custom waves
                                & custom shapes code
                            -changes will NOT pass on to the next frame, though;
                                use your own (custom) variables for that.
                        -can be modified in per-pixel code...
                            -changes will pass on to the next *pixel*, but no further
                            -changes will NOT pass on to the q1-q8 vars in the custom
                                waves or custom shapes code.
                            -changes will NOT pass on to the next frame, after the
                                last pixel, though.

                                values as described above.
                            -can be modified in the custom shape per-frame code, but only

                            -start with the same values as q1-q8 had at the end of the *preset*
                                per-frame code, this frame
                            -can be modified in the init code, but only for a one-time
                                pass-on to the per-frame code.  For all subsequent frames
                                (after the first), the per-frame code will get the q1-q8
                                values as described above.
                            -can be modified in the custom wave per-frame code; changes will
                                pass on to the per-point code, but that's it.
                            -can be modified in the per-point code, and the modified values
                                will pass on from point to point, but won't carry beyond that.
                        -CUSTOM WAVES: t1-t8...
                            -allow you to generate & save values in the custom wave init code,
                                that can pass on to the per-frame and, more sigificantly,
                                per-point code (since it's in a different variable pool).
                            -...



                        !-whatever the values of q1-q8 were at the end of the per-frame and per-pixel
                            code, these are copied to the q1-q8 variables in the custom wave & custom
                            shape code, for that frame.  However, those values are separate.
                            For example, if you modify q1-q8 in the custom wave #1 code, those changes
                            will not be visible anywhere else; if you modify q1-q8 in the custom shape
                            #2 code, same thing.  However, if you modify q1-q8 in the per-frame custom
                            wave code, those modified values WILL be visible to the per-point custom
                            wave code, and can be modified within it; but after the last point,
                            the values q1-q8 will be discarded; on the next frame, in custom wave #1
                            per-frame code, the values will be freshly copied from the values of the
                            main q1-q8 after the preset's per-frame and per-point code have both been
                            executed.
                    -monitor:
                        -can be read/written in preset init code & preset per-frame code.
                        -not accessible from per-pixel code.
                        -if you write it on one frame, then that value persists to the next frame.

                    -put in the stuff recommended by VMS (vidcap, etc.)
                    -add to troubleshooting:
                        1) desktop mode icons not appearing?  or
                           onscreen text looking like colored boxes?
                             -> try freeing up some video memory.  lower your res; drop to 16 bit;
                                etc.  TURN OFF AUTO SONGTITLES.
                        1) slow desktop/fullscr mode?  -> try disabling auto songtitles + desktop icons.
                            also try reducing texsize to 256x256, since that eats memory that the text surface could claim.
                        2)
                        3)
        *   -presets:
                -add new
                -fix 3d presets (bring gammas back down to ~1.0)
                -check old ones, make sure they're ok
                    -"Rovastar - Bytes"
                    -check wave_y
        *   -document custom waves & shapes
        *   -slow text is mostly fixed... =(
                -desktop icons + playlist both have begin/end around them now, but in desktop mode,
                 if you bring up playlist or Load menu, fps drops in half; press Esc, and fps doesn't go back up.
            -
            -
            -
        -DONE / v1.04:
            -updated to VMS 1.05
                -[list benefits...]
                -
                -
            -3d mode:
                a) SWAPPED DEFAULT L/R LENS COLORS!  All images on the web are left=red, right=blue!
                b) fixed image display when viewing a 3D preset in a non-4:3 aspect ratio window
                c) gamma now works for 3d presets!  (note: you might have to update your old presets.
                        if they were 3D presets, the gamma was ignored and 1.0 was used; now,
                        if gamma was >1.0 in the old preset, it will probably appear extremely bright.)
                d) added SHIFT+F9 and CTRL+C9 to inc/dec stereo separation
                e) added default stereo separation to config panel
            -cranked up the max. mesh size (was 48x36, now 64x48) and the default mesh size
                (was 24x18, now 32x24)
            -fixed aspect ratio for final display
            -auto-texsize is now computed slightly differently; for vertically or horizontally-stretched
                windows, the texsize is now biased more toward the larger dimension (vs. just the
                average).
            -added anisotropic filtering (for machines that support it)
            -fixed bug where the values of many variables in the preset init code were not set prior
                to execution of the init code (e.g. time, bass, etc. were all broken!)
            -added various preset blend effects.  In addition to the old uniform fade, there is
                now a directional wipe, radial wipe, and plasma fade.
            -FIXED SLOW TEXT for DX8 (at least, on the geforce 4).
                Not using DT_RIGHT or DT_BOTTOM was the key.


        -why does text kill it in desktop mode?
        -text is SLOOW
        -to do: add (and use) song title font + tooltip font
        -re-test: menus, text, boxes, etc.
        -re-test: TIME
        -testing:
            -make sure sound works perfectly.  (had to repro old pre-vms sound analysis!)
            -autogamma: currently assumes/requires that GetFrame() resets to 0 on a mode change
                (i.e. windowed -> fullscreen)... is that the case?
            -restore motion vectors
            -
            -
        -restore lost surfaces
        -test bRedraw flag (desktop mode/paused)
        -search for //? in milkdropfs.cpp and fix things

        problem: no good soln for VJ mode
        problem: D3DX won't give you solid background for your text.
            soln: (for later-) create wrapper fn that draws w/solid bkg.

        SOLN?: use D3DX to draw all text (plugin.cpp stuff AND playlist);
        then, for VJ mode, create a 2nd DxContext
        w/its own window + windowproc + fonts.  (YUCK)
    1) config panel: test, and add WM_HELP's (copy from tooltips)
    2) keyboard input: test; and...
        -need to reset UI_MODE when playlist is turned on, and
        -need to reset m_show_playlist when UI_MODE is changed.  (?)
        -(otherwise they can both show @ same time and will fight
            for keys and draw over each other)
    3) comment out most of D3D stuff in milkdropfs.cpp, and then
        get it running w/o any milkdrop, but with text, etc.
    4) sound

  Issues / To Do Later
  --------------------
    1) sprites: color keying stuff probably won't work any more...
    2) scroll lock: pull code from Monkey
    3) m_nGridY should not always be m_nGridX*3/4!
    4) get solid backgrounds for menus, waitstring code, etc.
        (make a wrapper function!)

    99) at end: update help screen

  Things that will be different
  -----------------------------
    1) font sizes are no longer relative to size of window; they are absolute.
    2) 'don't clear screen at startup' option is gone
    3) 'always on top' option is gone
    4) text will not be black-on-white when an inverted-color preset is showing

                -VJ mode:
                    -notes
                        1. (remember window size/pos, and save it from session to session?  nah.)
                        2. (kiv: scroll lock)
                        3. (VJ window + desktop mode:)
                                -ok w/o VJ mode
                                -w/VJ mode, regardless of 'fix slow text' option, probs w/focus;
                                    click on vj window, and plugin window flashes to top of Z order!
                                -goes away if you comment out 1st call to PushWindowToJustBeforeDesktop()...
                                -when you disable PushWindowToJustBeforeDesktop:
                                    -..and click on EITHER window, milkdrop jumps in front of the taskbar.
                                    -..and click on a non-MD window, nothing happens.
                                d-FIXED somehow, magically, while fixing bugs w/true fullscreen mode!
                        4. (VJ window + true fullscreen mode:)
                                d-make sure VJ window gets placed on the right monitor, at startup,
                                    and respects taskbar posn.
                                d-bug - start in windowed mode, then dbl-clk to go [true] fullscreen
                                    on 2nd monitor, all with VJ mode on, and it excepts somewhere
                                    in m_text.DrawNow() in a call to DrawPrimitive()!
                                    FIXED - had to check m_vjd3d8_device->TestCooperativeLevel
                                    each frame, and destroy/reinit if device needed reset.
                                d-can't resize VJ window when grfx window is running true fullscreen!
                                    -FIXED, by dropping the Sleep(30)/return when m_lost_focus
                                        was true, and by not consuming WM_NCACTIVATE in true fullscreen
                                        mode when m_hTextWnd was present, since DX8 doesn't do its
                                        auto-minimize thing in that case.



========================================================================================================
SPOUT :

  Credit to psilocin@openmailbox.org for the original idea to convert MilkDrop for Spout output

  22.10.14 - changed from Ctrl-Z on and off to default Spout output when the plugin starts
         and Ctrl-Z to disable and enable while it is running. Otherwise Spout has to be re-enabled
         every time another track is selected.
  30.10.14 - changed from Glut to pixelformat and OpenGL context creation
  31.10.14 - changed initialization section to renderframe to ensure correct frame size
       - added Ctrl-D user selection of DirectX mode
       - flag bUseDX11 to select either DirectX 9 or DirectX 11
       - saved DX mode flag in configuration file
  05.11.14 - Included Spout options in the Visualization configuration control panel
        Options -> Visualizatiosn -> Configure Plugin
        MORE SETTINGS tab
          Enable Spout output
          Enable Spout DirectX 11 mode
        Settings are saved with OK
       - retained Ctrl-Z for spout on / off while the Visualizer is running
       - included Ctrl-D to change from DirectX 9 to DirectX 11
         (this might be removed in a future release if it gives trouble)
         The selected settings are saved when the Visualizer is stopped.
  25.04.15 - Changed Spout SDK from graphics auto detection to set DirectX mode to optional installer
       - Recompile for dual DX option installer
  17.06.15 - User observation that custom messages do not work.
         This is isolated to "RenderStringToTitleTexture" and seems to be related to
         generating the fonts from GDI to DX9. Not sure of the reason. Could be DX9 libraries.
         As a a workaround, custom message rendering is replaced with the same as used for
         title animation which works OK. The limitation is that this gives a fixed font,
         but the colour should come out the same as in the custom message setup file.
  07.07.15 - Recompile for 2.004 release
  15.09.15 - Recompile for 2.005 release - revised memoryshare SDK
  08.11.15 - removed directX9/directX11 option for 2.005
       - OpenSender and milkdropfs.cpp - removed XRGB format option and always send as ARGB
  12.11.18 - Removed DX11 (bUseDX11) option from plugin - test for user DX9 selection instead
  02.12.18 - Rebuild VS2017 /MT with VS2010 100 toolset - Spout 2.007
         (VS2017 140 toolset does not work)


  03.12.18 - Started modifications to the BeatDrop project (not back-compatible)
         BeatDrop name, versioning and authoring by Maxim Volskiy retained
         Use the VJ console for help and text output.
         Output resolution is 1920x1080 at start
         Resolution can subsequently be changed by resizing the render window
         The render window can be hidden with the F12 key
         and the VJ console can be minimized when not being used
         without affecting Spout output.
  04.12.18 - Monitor dpi awareness for scaled displays
         Reset help or menu text when activating either of them
         Disable minimize and maximize
         Use SpoutLibrary instead of Spout SDK source files
         Cleanup
         Rebuild VS2017 /MT with Visual Studio 2017 toolset (v141)
    05.12.18 : Create GitHub fork and update. Publish release 1001.
               Bring up the VJ console for F1 help if it has been minimised
         PluginShell.cpp - remove maximize from VJ window
  21.12.18 : Update SpoutLibrary - Version 2.007
  03.01.19 : Rebuild SpoutLibrary
         Rebuild VS2017 /MT with Visual Studio 2017 toolset (v141)
  16.01.19   TODO : Bug when resizing - re-creates the sender with a new name.
  29.04.19   Noted : setting  Monitor dpi awareness uusing Manifest tool compiler option
         results in blurry text for the console window. Retained SetProcessDpiAwareness
         Noted : warning 'Zc:forScope-' - deprecated for VS2017
         For future Visual Studio compilers, might need changes throughout for loops
  31.05.19   Rebuild with revised 2.007 SpoutLibrary
         VS2017 /MT with Visual Studio 2017 toolset (v141), Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0
