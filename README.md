## History

The original [MilkDrop2](https://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) WinAmp plugin created by Ryan Geiss was turned into a Windows standalone application by Maxim Volskiy as [BeatDrop](https://github.com/mvsoft74/BeatDrop). Milkwave originally started as a fork of the [BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer](https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer) BeatDrop fork.

For a more detailed explanation of all features, please read the [Manual](https://github.com/IkeC/Milkwave/blob/main/Manual.md). 

For a chronological list of Milkwave releases and features, read the [Changes](Changes.md).

Although the original Matthew van Eerde's [loopback-capture](https://github.com/mvaneerde/blog) project didn't explicitly state the license, the author has been kind enough to provide a license clarification [here](

## Public use of MilkDrop Presets

The presets themselves are not covered by either of these licenses, they either have their own license or none (in most cases). None of the presets in Milkwave should have a restrictive license preventing you from using them in public. All preset filenames from shaders I converted have the original author's name in them, with the full original source mentioned in the preset file itself.

So, my pragmatic and common sense approach would be: Always keep in mind that you are using the artistic work of someone else. Respect the original authors work by showing the preset filename (at least briefly), and you should be fine. If in doubt, always ask the creator of the piece you use.
