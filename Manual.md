# Milkwave Manual

Welcome to the Milkwave manual! This document will help you get started with the Milkwave Remote, a tool to control the Milkwave Visualizer.

In general, make sure to hover the mouse over all labels and buttons to see some inline help tooltips describing most of the features and displaying keyboard shortcuts.

If you need help with the Visualizer itself, press F1 there to see the on-screen help pages. Also take a look at the documentation in the _resources/docs_ folder.

# Interface

The Tabs panel (top half) holds most features available in the Remote, described in detail below.

The Buttons panel (bottom half) has two modes: "Command" mode and "Preset" mode. You can switch between modes using the blue arrows button in the lower right corner.

**Command mode** allows to trigger some commonly used functions in the Visualizer without having to focus the Visualizer window. At the bottom, the buttons will show preview images and trigger the sprites from _sprites.ini_ when Visualizer is in sprite mode (default). You can change the images for all buttons (except the first one) by right-clicking the button and selecting an image.

Press K in Visualizer or the button "Sprite/Msg Mode" to change modes. When Visualizer is in message mode, the Remote panel buttons will be labeled 00-99. The button tooltip will show what message will be sent (if a matching definition is defined in _messages.ini_).

**Preset mode** allows you to assign the currently running preset to a button by right-clicking it. After assignmwent, the button will display a preview image of the preset. Left-clicking the button will start the preset in Visualizer, a middle-click will clear it. You can use blue numbered button in the lower right to switch between 3 banks of preset buttons, giving you a total of 45 assignable preset buttons. You can also press each of these buttons from script or MIDI using the command "BTN=<number>" (see _script-default.txt_ for details).

Note that you can choose to hide either the Tabs or the Button panel with the popup menu that opens by clicking "Milkwave" in the bottom right corner. You may also use the menu to access help resources, open the Visualizer window, switch between light and dark mode, and toggle color or monochrome button image display.

At the bottom, you can left-click the status bar to copy its content to the clipboard, middle-click to set a "compact" mode, or right-click to quickly switch between tabs and button panel. You can set the "compact" mode size in _settings-remote.json_ using the key _RemoteWindowCompactSize_.

CPU and GPU usage are displayed at the bottom right if enabled. Click the "Milkwave" button at the bottom right to expand a menu providing quick access to additional application settings and information resources.

## Tab "Preset"

Send a preset from the drop-down list to display in the Visualizer using "Send". The list will show the presets from _presets/Milkwave_ by default. You can fill the list using the buttons "Tags", "File" and "Dir".

The currently playing Visualizer preset is displayed after the "Running" label. After "Tags" you can supply your own set of tags describing the current preset, separated by comma. If "Running" is checked, the tags are loaded (and saved to) the currently running preset, if it is unchecked the preset from the drop-down list in the first line is used. Click "Save" to save the tag information to tags-remote.json.

Your most used tags are displayed as buttons automatically after the "Most used" label. Note that you may delete the file _tags-remote.json_ anytime if you want to start from scratch.

## Tab "Message"

Use "Send" to send the text after "Message" to display in the Visualizer window. Toggle "Preview" to see a "what you see is what you get" version of your text. If "Wrap" is checked, text will be wrapped to two lines if the text is longer than the number in the drop-down box. You can manually define a line break within your text by writing "//". Note that this feature is rather experimental and may clip your text sometimes depending on your used font face and size.

Right-Click the "Parameters" label to display a list of all available parameters for the text message display. You can save a parameter line to the named slot after "Style" by pressing "Save".

Changing "Font", "Size" and "Color" parameters will change the text display. Note that these definitions can be "Set" to the "Parameters" line. If any of these values are defined in "Parameters", they will override your UI settings. To remove a set definition from "Parameters", you may double-click the "Font", "Size" and "Color" labels.

You can load a list of parameter lines from a file and send them to the Visualizer individually by pressing the "Send" button in the bottom right. By default, the file _script-default.txt_ from the Milkwave main directory is loaded, but you can load any file by right-clicking the "From File" label. Please read the documentation in _script-default.txt_ for a detailed description on possible commands.

Instead of selecting and sending lines from the fine manually, you may check the "Autoplay" to play them sequentially. Use the "BPM" and "Beats" parameters to control the interval between sending each line. Check the "Rand" button to send a random line on each interval (excluding the last sent line).

"Config" allows you to quickly open the most important configuration files in a text editor. You may also open Shanes [Message Editor](https://github.com/shanevbg/MDx12Messages) from here to edit the _messages.ini_ file in a more user-friendly way.

### Fade-in, Fade-Out and Burntime

You can define default values for fade-in ("fade", default 0.2), fade-out ("fadeout", default 0.0) and burntime ("burntime", default 0.1) in settings.ini, and override them per message as a parameter.

If a burntime > 0 is defined, the message will be "baked" into the background and slowly fade away for the defined burntime duration. Note that this won't work with all presets, and if you define a fadeout > 0, the burntime will be irrelevant because the message will fade out before there's something to "burn in".

## Tab "In/Out"

The "Window" label shows the window title of the Visualizer that the Remote will send its commands to. You may start multiple Visualizer windows and control them all by changing the target window. Change the opacity of the Visualizer window using the "%" box.

Check "DX12" to use the MDropDX12 Visualizer instead of the standard Milkwave Visualizer. In this mode, commands are sent via named pipe rather than window messages. The configurable executable names are stored in _settings-remote.json_ as _VisualizerExe_ and _VisualizerExeDX12_.

Your audio input and output devices are displayed after the "Device" label. If you don't wish to see input devices (such as microphones), set _settings.ini:IncludeInputDevices=0_. Use "Set" to set the Visualizer input source to the selected device. Use Ctrl+D in the Visualizer window to display the currently active device.

Use "Amp" to amplify the virtual audio level for the Visualizer, eg. if you feel the preset should react more to your music. If "Link" is checked, left and right audio channels are amplified equally.

The elements here also allow you to mix video sources such as webcams or Spout feeds into the Visualizer output. You can either mix a webcam input or a Spout feed, using the "Mix" buttons. If you want to use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) as a source, activate Spout output in OBS rather than using the OBS virtual camera, as the latter is not supported by Milkwave.

Set Luma Key to "Active" to make a certain color in the input source transparent. Adjust threshold to set the tolerance for the keying, and adjust "Softness" to make the edges of the keyed area softer.

"Top Layer" allows you to set either the input source or the Visualizer's preset rendering as the top layer of the Visualizer output. "Opacity" sets the opacity of the top layer.

"Controller" allows you to select a game controller. If "Active", it will send the commands defined in _controller-remote.json_ to the Visualizer when you press buttons. You can edit the command list in _controller-remote.json_ or use the "Config" button to open the file in a text editor.

### Network Remote

You can control Milwave Visualuzer or MDropDX12 instances running on remote machines over TCP. 

On the client side, network targets are configured in _network-remote.json_ and appear in the Visualizer combobox alongside local instances. Each target must set `active=true` to show up, and the entry label is the value of `name`. When a network target is selected, commands are sent to the Visualizer's TCP server instead of a local named pipe.

On the machine running Milkwave Remote, edit _network-remote.json_ and configure an entry with the remote machine's IP address, port, and (optional) PIN:

```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "active": true,
      "name": "MDropDX12 (Remote)",
      "host": "192.168.1.100",
      "port": 9270,
      "pin": "",
      "deviceId": "milkwave-remote-1",
      "deviceName": "Milkwave Remote"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only targets with `active=true` are shown in the combobox. If "Multi" is checked, commands are broadcast to all local instances and all active network targets.

To configure **MDropDX12** on the server side, start MDropDX12 and enable the TCP server in **Settings (F8) → "Tools" tab → "Open Remote"**. In the **"Authorization"** tab, enable the TCP Server. Alternatively, set `TcpEnabled=1` in the `[Network]` section of _settings.ini_. The default port is **9270**. If the remote MDropDX12 has not authorized this device yet, the status bar will show "Waiting for approval" — approve the pending device in "Clients".

To configure **Milkwave Visualizer** on the server side and see the server status, press Ctrl+N in the Visualizer. Alternatively, set `TcpEnabled=1` in the `[Network]` section of _settings.ini_. You may also specify a different port with `TcpPort` and a PIN (plain text) using `TcpPIN`.

## Tab "Settings"

Change the internal "Time", "FPS" and "Frame" values that the Visualizer sends to the preset. This may speed up, slow down or otherwise change the behaviour of the preset, depending on how the preset is built and how (or if) it uses any of these variables.

The "Intensity", "Shift" and "Version" values can be read by presets that support the Milkwave specific vis_intensity, vis_shift and vis_version variables (see below). As above, you can change these values live while a preset is running.

With "Hue", "Saturation" and "Brightness", you can change the overall color tone of the Visualizer output. This may be useful if you want to adapt the colors of a preset to your room lighting, or just want to experiment with different looks. You may also set "Auto" to automatically shift the colors over time.

With the "Quality" setting, you can reduce the size of the backbuffer used for rendering, eg. a quality factor of 0.5 will render to an internal buffer with half the width and height of your Visualizer window. This will improve performance on slower systems, but will also reduce visual quality. A low quality may also yield in a pixellated look, giving a nice retro effect. Note that the quality setting will be ignored if "Fixed" Spout resolution is used.

If you select "Auto", Milkwave tries to make the "perceived" Visualizer quality similar on different window sizes by adjusting the backbuffer size accordingly.

Keep in mind that many settings can be automated using script commands in the _script-default.txt_ file or your own script files. See the comments in _script-default.txt_ for details. They can also be MIDI-controlled (see below).

For [Spout](https://spout.zeal.co/), you can set the output to a "Fixed" resolution instead of the Visualizer window size. This may be useful if you want to use Milkwave as a source for other applications that expect a certain resolution. The Visualizer window will then use the fixed backbuffer size and aspect ratio for display.

The "Preset" row allows you to set the lock mode for the current preset (same as pressing ~ in the Visualizer). If "Locked" is checked, the preset will not changed as time progresses. If unlocked, it will change after the time defined by "Next after" (plus blending times). "Random" toggles between random and sequential preset order (same as pressing "R" in the Visualizer).

"Compile" allows you to precompile the shaders defined in _precompile.txt_. This will usually take 2-3 minutes and happen in the background. You may also "Clear" the cache, which will simply remove all files from the _cache_ folder. This may be useful if you want to reset all shaders to be recompiled, eg. after a Milkwave update.

With FFT you may control equalizer attack and decay values for presets supporting FFT functions *get_fft(pos)* and *get_fft_hz(freq)*, such as _IkeC - Equalizer.milk_ from the _Milkwave_ presets folder. *get_fft_peak_hz(freq)* is exclusive to Milkwave.

## Tab "Fonts"

Modify most of the fonts used to display information in the Visualizer window. Use "Save" and "Test" to see your changes. You can save and preview changes instantly if you hold the ALT key while changing fonts or sizes.

Changes are saved to the _Fonts_ section in _settings.ini_. Of course you may edit them there manually as well.

## Tab "MIDI"

You can control many of the Remote and Visualizer features using MIDI controllers. First, select your MIDI input device from the drop-down list. If your device is not listed, make sure it is connected and recognized by Windows, then click "Scan".

You can assign up to 50 actions for your controls. Switch to higher rows using the "Bank" control. Press "Learn" and push or turn your MIDI control for Milkwave to recognize it. You'll see the "Channel", "Value" and "Controller" boxes change their values if this works. When the control is learned, turn off "Learn" and select an "Action" for your control.

When not in "learning" mode, all rows marked as "Active" will be taken into account when a MIDI event is received. Double-click a row number to clear the row.

Milkwave differentiates between two types of MIDI controls: "Button/Note" and "Knob/Fader". A button or note is just a trigger for an action, while a knob or fader sends a MIDI value between 0 and 127.

"Knob/Fader" actions are fixed, you can select the different options from the the drop-down list. The default value of a control is usually set to the middle setting of your knob or fader (MIDI value 64). In the "Inc" box, you can define how much the value of the target control is changed for every MIDI value change.

Example: You assign a knob on your MIDI keyboard to "Settings: Intensity", with an "Inc" value of 0.05. The default value for "Intensity" is 1, which is assigned to the middle setting of your knob (MIDI value 64). Now if you turn your keyboard knob all the way up to 127, the "Intensity" value in the Remote will be set to 1+(63\*0.05)=3.15. If you turn it down, it will go down to 0 in the Remote. Values are capped between the possible values a control supports, so eg. "Intensity" will never go below 0.

"Button/Note" events can trigger a lot of actions. You can select some default actions from the drop-down list, but these are just some common examples - you can type freely into the box. You may also edit the default action list by editing _midi-default.txt_ in the Milkwave folder.

An action can be any command or string of commands that can also be triggered by script. You can also trigger lines (current, next, previous or specific) from the currently loaded script file ("From File" in the "Message" tab). Actions include selecting and changing presets, sending messages, triggering sprites, starting external programs and lots more. Please read the documentation in _script-default.txt_ for a detailed description on possible commands and command chains.

Your MIDI assignments are kept in _midi-remote.json_ and automatically loaded and saved when you open/close the Remote. You may also load and save settings manually using the "L" and "S" buttons in the upper right corner.

If you want to hide the MIDI tab and prevent initialisation completely (eg. because it interferes with your MIDI setup in other programs), set MidiEnabled=false in _settings-remote.json_.

## Tab "Wave"

Manipulate factors of the default wave of the current preset and display the changes instantly in the Visualizer. If the "Link" button is checked, values are received from and sent to the currently running preset instantly, if not click "Send" to send your values. Use "Clear" to display a default wave. 

Use the "Quicksave" button or press Ctrl+S in the Visualizer to save the current preset instantly to the _presets/Quicksave_ folder as a new file. Press Shift+Ctrl+S to save to _presets/Quicksave2_ instead.

## Tab "Shader"

This tab can convert GLSL shader code (eg. from Shadertoy.com) to HLSL shader code, save it to a preset file and display it in the Visualizer instantly.

Click "Dir" to select a folder containing Shadertoy .json files. A possible source is [github.com/GabeRundlett/shadertoy-api-shaders](https://github.com/GabeRundlett/shadertoy-api-shaders). Select the file you want to load by changing the index number and clicking "Load". "Next" will automatically load the next file. Both "Load" and "Next" will convert and send the shader code to the Visualizer immediately. Your last selected directory and index number are saved to _settings-remote.json_ and restored upon restart.

You can show/hide the left pane with the "<" button. Click "Convert" to convert the GLSL code from the left pane to HLSL code in the right pane. Use "Send" to save a preset from the code and send it to the Visualizer.

The "File" checkbox determines whether the preset filename is built from the shaderinfo line or not. If you test many different shader code snippets, you may not want to produce a (possibly not working) preset file everytime, so if "File" is unchecked, the default filename "Shader.milk" will be used (and overwritten each time). You can set the pixel shader version written to the preset file using the number box before the "Send" button. If unsure, leave it at 4.

Note that the conversion process will most likely not produce a working preset right away, as some logical statements, terms and expressions cannot be converted easily. Some common problems are listed below, and I highly recommend at least watching the great [How to create Presets from OpenGL Shaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2gPa996Aw) video by Patrick Pomerleau (also listed below) to understand the process.

If you get conversion errors, they will be displayed in the Remote status bar. Milkwave will try to find the correct error line in the right pane and jump there, but it's not always exact due to the way the Visualizer compiles the preset file. You can use the number box ("offset") in the upper right corner to highlight the acutal error line. A common pratice is to add a deliberate error (like "xxx") to the code, set the offset to the correct line, then remove it. Subsequent errors will then be marked more precisely.

The upper right corner also features a search box to find text within the right pane. Use Ctrl+Shift+F to jump to the search box, and Ctrl+F to actually find the next occurence of the search text. The "L" button allows you to load shader code from a file, or extract it from an existing preset (comp shader lines only). The "?" button opens this manual in your browser.

Remember that it is your responsibility to check and respect the individual license of the code you use and convert. In any case, always make sure you give proper credit to the original author. If you converted a preset successfully, consider sharing it with the community so it may be included with future Milkwave releases.

# Milkwave Visualizer specifics

Milkwave Visualizer is based on MilkDrop2, supporting all its options and settings. In addition, some new variables were introduced to give preset authors more possibilities while keeping presets compatible to other MilkDrop2 based visualizers (eg. NestDrop, BeatDrop Music Visualizer or MilkDrop 3).

## "_smooth" preset variables

Milkwave 3 introduced these addtional variables for preset authors to use:
-  _bass_smooth, mid_smooth, treb_smooth, vol_smooth_

These provide much more softed versions than the standard _\*\_att_ variables, meaning the value change is much more subtle between each frame. If you want to use them in your preset but also stay compatible with other MilkDrop based visualizers, you can use the following code snippet:
```
#ifndef bass_smooth
#define bass_smooth bass_att
#endif
```
Or wrap your code in a conditional block:
```
#ifdef bass_smooth
float3 myColor = float3(sin(bass_smooth)+1, 0, 0);
#endif
```
## "vis_intensity", "vis_shift" and "vis_version" preset variables

Presets can use these variables to modify the intensity or other appearance aspects of a preset. The default values are 1.0 (float) for vis_intensity, 0.0 for vis_shift (float) and 1 for version (integer). Users can adjust these values live from the "Settings" tab in the Remote while the preset is running. They can also be assigned to MIDI controls.

See the Shader presets included with Milkwave for examples that make use of these parameters.

As with the _smooth parameters above, you may want to use defines like this in your preset to stay compatible with other MilkDrop based visualizers:
```
#ifndef vis_intensity
#define vis_intensity 1
#endif
```

## "colshift_hue", "colshift_saturation" and "colshift_brightness" preset variables

These all default to 0 and can be changed in the Remote settings tab. The values are used in the _shiftHSV()_ function which is included in Milkwaves _include.fx_ file.

If you've played around with one of these values and want to save it to the preset file, you would add something like this at the end of your comp shader definition: 

```
#ifdef colshift_saturation
  colshift_saturation += 0.5;
#endif
```

Note that this would be a Milkwave specific change that would not port over to other MilkDrop variants since they use a different _include.fx_. If you want a portable version, include your own version of _shiftHSV()_ in your preset and call that. See the "SnoopethDuckDuck + IkeC - Breeze" preset for an example.

# Closing Notes

This manual was written by IkeC. If you want to contribute to this manual or need further help, it's a good idea to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/IkeC/Milkwave/issues) or [join the Milkwave Discord server](https://bit.ly/Ikes-Discord). The latter is also a good place to share your presets or discuss with other users.
